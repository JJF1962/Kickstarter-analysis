## Performing analysis on Kirkstarter data for Louise Campaing
  * Louise is looking to better understand the performance of the campaings, and looks way to improve to accomplish the financial and dates goals.
### Class Purpose, following the guide of study and virtual classes, the idea is to become familiar with the following:
 * Firstly, It was looked the initial excel format and  data, to visualize and approach in the excel sheet.
 * Secondly,  It was  counted the numbers of rows, equal to 14, as I'm working in window 10, I pressed Ctrl and down arrow,to discover that the kirkstarter sheet had 4115 rows.and also visualized what type of data was in each colomun, general, accountig, date etc, Excel show it in the header bar, any time that you position in each column, after that it was formatted the cell as we did with  one of the columns with dates  for easy readable and understanding (Gregorian) as shown in colum S and T. Aditionally we learned commands that allow us to move faster in the sheet such as: Control A, allow to select the complete worksheet; Control Space to select a column, Control C to copy and Control V to paste. 
 * Thirdly, It was filtered the data, sort, and freze and unfreze  panels to move, allowing us to see all the time the first column and heathers, nthe combination is named panes. Also,  continue viewing the data, and it permitted us to learn and practice conditional formatting, extra filters, finding averages,Vlookup, If,Countif, Contifs, errors an debugging
 * Aditionally, It was studied the way to create  pivot table and Pivot chart, as for example the tabble for the subcategory statistics, that normally summarize, and make easier to visualize data, create graphs and  make conclusions. Use the serach function, and how to add statistics (mean,media and mode) that allow also  to make conclusions based on calculations (Measures of central tendency: mean, medi and mode) and create the analysis using nmeasuring of central tendency with crowfunding data such as fiiletring on the outcome column the successful, failed and canceled campaings (column D) and  play (colum R), and the US country in canvas.   In the Chart section we learned how to insertcharts, the recommended one, very convenient and easy to use, or by the contrary select the different charts options and create it by our selves, the most important thing is the chart must be clear and shows exactly what we intend to demostrate, also the charts allow us to filter columns, etc. Furthermore we learned how to create and set measure of spread, variance, Standard deviation, quartile and to create Box plogs graphs, this last one no included in our assigment but deepest studied in class and included in the canvas material.
We learned, how to set the GitHub account in the Git Hub website and how to create repositories, Readme, upload files, etc.
Finally we be ready to submit our Module 1 challenge.
### Analysis and challenges
 * The first challenge was to understand the need of Louise, to see the outcomes by Launch date, to do that, I went to the main data file Kirkstarter, and it was created column(Q), parent category and subcategory (R), and offcourse the columns (S,T & U) Date Created Conversion, Date ended conversion, solution and year respectively after that it was set a Pivot table filtered by year and parent category "Theater", we use the fourmula counts to set the column with "months" and we add the outcomes under columns to create 3 columns in the Pivot Table  understand and graph the Theater Outcomes by Launch month, with a Grand Total,as shown in figure 1 below.

* Second Challenge was to the set a chart based on Goals, to detrmine it, it was filetered the outcome column in suceessful, Failed and canceled, also the require to filer only the "palys", therefore we filtered it in the subcategory column "R", it was challenging for me to apply the formula directly in the Kirckstartr sheet, therefore I did copy paste of the column D two 2 times, first with the succesful and secondly with the failed, I have no need to copy the cancel one, because was "Cero", not exist at the momento filetered in the fileter options in colunm D, after that I set the the table as requested in the challenge 1, and apply the formula Countifs, to calculate the number of project in each goal range,  and calculate the percentages dividing the total in Column L with the amount indicated in each row of columns L (Succesful), J (Failed) and K (canceled), add the sumatory to calculate the total values, and finally generate the chart shown in Figure 2 below.

### Conclusion
* To conclude the first challenge "Outcomes by Launch date" described and sumarized in Figure # 1  A total of 839 campaings  (theater)  were succesful, the best months were May and June, However 36% of the campaings failed, and 37% were cancelled and the picks of cancelletion were 4 campains each month during the month of June, august and september, that allow to coclude that only  61% of The campaing for the parent category "Theater" were successfull.
*  To conclude the second challenge "Outcomes based on Goals" described and sumarized in figure # 2, it was executed 1047 of the subcategory "plays" projects with not cancelations, that is very good results, however, only the 66% of the projects accomplished the goals and 34% not.
